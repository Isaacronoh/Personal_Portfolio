    <h3><u> Planting </u> </h3>
      <p>
        For successful banana farming, proper spacing is essential to maximize yields and maintain healthy plants. 
        Traditional banana varieties should be spaced at 3 meters by 3 meters, allowing about 450 plants per acre, 
        while tissue culture bananas can be planted more densely at 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters, accommodating around
         625- 650 plants per acre. For farmers practicing high-density planting, especially with access to irrigation 
         and good soil, spacing can be reduced to 2 meters by 2.5 meters, supporting up to 1600 plants per acre. 
         The right spacing depends on the variety, soil fertility, and water availability, and ensures good sunlight 
         exposure, air circulation, and ease of management.

      <h3><u> Watering </u> </h3>
      <p>
        Watering banana suckers is essential for healthy establishment and growth. After planting, water the suckers 
        immediately to help settle the soil and support root development. Keep the soil consistently moist, especially
         during dry periods, by watering 2–3 times per week, but avoid overwatering as bananas are sensitive to 
         waterlogging. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot, and use mulch around the base to retain moisture. 
         If available, drip irrigation is ideal for efficient water use. Always monitor the plants—wilting or dry soil 
         indicates under-watering, while yellowing or soft leaves may suggest overwatering.

      <h3><u> Maturity </u> </h3>
      <p>
         Bananas typically take 9 to 15 months to mature and produce edible fruit, depending on the variety and growing
         conditions. Tissue culture bananas mature faster, usually within 9 to 12 months, while traditional varieties
          may take up to **15 months**. Once the banana bunch appears, the fruits are ready for harvesting as green 
          bananas (for cooking, like matoke) in about 3 to 4 months, when they are full-sized and firm. For yellow,
           ripe bananas, the harvested green fruits can be ripened naturally in 7 to 10 days, or left to ripen on the 
           plant, though this risks pest damage. Proper care, irrigation, and timely weeding help ensure faster maturity
            and better yields.

       <h3><u> Marketing Strategy </u> </h3>
        <p>
        A good marketing strategy for bananas involves targeting both local and regional markets by ensuring a 
        consistent supply of high-quality fruit, whether green for cooking or ripe for eating. Farmers should 
        form or join cooperative groups to aggregate produce, reduce transport costs, and negotiate better prices. 
        Establishing direct relationships with vendors, supermarkets, schools, and restaurants can secure stable 
        buyers. Using social media and local market days to promote the freshness and availability of bananas helps 
        attract walk-in and bulk buyers. Value addition, such as selling ripe bananas, banana chips, or flour, can 
        also increase income. Consistency, quality, and timely delivery are key to building trust and customer 
        loyalty.
